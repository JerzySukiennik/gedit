"""Frozen pretrained CLIP text encoder — the one part of Gedit NOT trained
from scratch (see SPEC.md #2: hand-training a text encoder good enough to
understand arbitrary edit instructions is a separate project the size of
MicroG itself).

Returns the full per-token sequence (last_hidden_state), not the pooled
projection — cross-attention (model/unet.py) needs one vector PER WORD to
know which token refers to which part of the image ("hat" -> the head
region). A single pooled vector (what CLIPTextModelWithProjection gives)
carries no per-word/spatial information, which is exactly why the earlier
FiLM-only design (see git history) couldn't localize object edits like
"add a hat".
